## CookBook

A web application for documenting, sharing and discovering food recipes.


## A MEAN.JS application

The application uses the [MEAN.JS](http://meanjs.org/)-stack and is scaffolded using [meanjs-generator](http://meanjs.org/generator.html) with [Yeoman generator](http://yeoman.io/index.html).

The MEAN.JS stack consists of the following JavaScript-based projects: [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).

This is my first experiment with the full stack.
